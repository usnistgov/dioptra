# This docker-compose file allows you to merge and override entries in the
# configuration generated by cookiecutter to customize your Dioptra deployment.
# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/multiple-compose-files/merge/ for details
# on how Docker Compose merges multiple Compose files together.
#
# A common use case is to add custom mounts to Dioptra worker containers. An
# example configuration is provided below commented out to use as a starting
# point. Copy this .template file to docker-compose.override.yml and make
# configuration changes.
#
# A datasets directory is configured in the main docker-compose.yml file in the
# cookicutter deployment generation. It is recommended that datasets_directory
# be left blank if mounts are being configured here.
