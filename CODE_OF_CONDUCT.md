# Code of Conduct

## Criteria for Contributions and Feedback

This is a moderated platform. NIST will only accept contributions that are contributed per the terms of the license file. All contributors must add their name to the [CONTRIBUTORS](./CONTRIBUTORS.md) file to affirmatively indicate acceptance of the license terms. Contributions cannot be accepted from user accounts for which this acceptance has not been done. Upon submission, materials will be public and considered publicly available information, unless noted in the license file.

NIST reserves the right to reject, remove, or edit any contribution or feedback, including anything that:

-   states or implies NIST endorsement of any entities, services, or products;

-   is inaccurate;

-   contains abusive or vulgar content, spam, hate speech, personal attacks, or similar content;

-   is clearly "off topic";

-   makes unsupported accusations;

-   includes personally identifiable or business identifiable information according to Department of Commerce Office of Privacy and Open Government [guidelines](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/opog/DOC_PA_PII_and_BII_Breach_Notification_Plan.pdf)

-   following the contribution instructions;

-   responding to feedback from other repository users in a timely manner;

-   responding to NIST representatives in a timely manner;
