    Update/modify the given symbol tree such that it includes the given

    The symbol tree is conceptually roughly a symbol hierarchy.  This is how
    modules and other types of values are naturally arranged in Python.  An
    import statement (assuming it is correct, and in the absence of any way or
    desire to check, we assume they are all correct) reflects this hierarchy,
    and the hierarchy may be inferred from it.

    It is implemented as a nested dict of dicts.  The dicts map a symbol name
    to other dicts which may have other symbol names, which map to other dicts,
    etc.  One can look up a symbol to get a "value", but we don't actually have
    access to any runtime values.  A symbol's "value" in this tree will be
    whatever dict it maps to (which may be empty).

    Importantly, aliasing present in import statements ("as" clauses) is
    reflected in the symbol tree by referring to the same dict in multiple
    places.  This means the structure is not technically a tree, since nodes
    can have in-degree greater than one.  But it makes aliasing trivial to
    deal with: you can use the "is" operator to check whether two symbols'
    "values" are the same.
