# The type ignore below is necessary because it seems to be impossible to
# express the correct types in the overloads below.  Mypy treats "str" as
# compatible with "Iterable[str]".  Technically that's not wrong, since you can
# iterate through a string and get strings (all length-1, the individual
# characters).  But the implementation special cases str as:
#
#     if isinstance(name, str):
#         ...  # first overload
#     else:
#         ...  # second overload
#
# So what I really need to be able to express are two cases: (1) str and
# (2) Iterable[str] *but not str itself!*  I think there is no way to write a
# type annotation with a negative clause which excludes a special case.  So
# mypy gives the error that the overloads "overlap with incompatible return
# types".  It also says: "Flipping the order of overloads will fix this error",
# and it did make the error go away, but also causes mypy to misunderstand
# function calls (match them to the wrong overload).  So it's really just
# trading one mypy error for another.
#
# It seems the only thing you can do for now is use the overload order below,
# and turn the overload-overlap error off.
