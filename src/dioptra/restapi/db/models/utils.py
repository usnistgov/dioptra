    Create a repr string for the given instance, with a depth limit to avoid

    The depth does not count depth of normal list/map-like data structures; it
    counts nested instances of ORM-mapped objects.  If a data structure is
    passed which does not contain any ORM instances, max_depth will have no
    effect and the value will be repr'd in its entirety.
