====================================
 Resource Search Language Reference
====================================

This document describes the language used to search for resources when using GET queries.

.. contents::

Overview
========

Dioptra defines a query language used for searching for resources. The language is used when 
submitting GET queries for endpoints, in order to narrow down the resources returned to a 
specific set which matches the specifications of the search parameters.

Features
========


Wildcard ``*``
------------

The ``*`` character can be used as a wildcard to represent an arbitrary number of characters.

Example usage:
    * ``search_term_*`` - will search for all text fields that start with ``search_term_``
    
Note that escaping the character, such as in ``search_term_\*`` will result in a search of all
text fields that exactly match ``search_term_*``.


Wildcard ``?``
------------

The ``?`` character can be used as a wildcard to represent a single character.

Example usage:
    * ``search_term_?`` - will search for all text fields that start with ``search_term_`` and only
    have one additional character.

    * ``search_term_??`` - will search for all text fields that start with ``search_term_`` and have 
    two additional characters.


Quotation Marks ``""``
--------------------

Search terms quoted with ``"`` can contain spaces and other characters.

Example usage:
    * ``"search \"this\", and 'that'"`` - will search for all text fields that exactly
    match ``search "this", and 'that'``


Commas ``,``
----------

Search terms can be combined using commas.

Example usage:
    * ``search_term_1, search_terms_*, "search_term_3"`` - will search for all text fields that
    match either ``search_term_1``, start with ``search_terms_`` or match ``search_term_3``.


Searching by Field Name ``field:``
--------------------------------

The name of a field, for example ``tag``, ``name``, ``description``, etc. can be used to search
for resources. 

Note that quotation marks should be used to include spaces in a single search term.

Example usage:
    * ``tag:my_search_tag`` - will search the tags of resources of this type for text which exactly matches
    ``my_search_tag``

    * ``name:experiment_1`` - will search the names of resources of this type for text that exactly matches
    ``experiment_1``

    * ``description:*LLM*`` - will search the descriptions of resources of this type for text containing
    ``LLM``

    * ``tag:tag1,tag:tag2`` - will search the tags of resources of this type for text which exactly matches
    ``tag1`` or ``tag2``

    * ``tag:"this is a tag with spaces"`` - will search the tags of resources of this type for text which
    exactly matches ``this is a tag with spaces``

Escaped Characters ``\``
----------------------

The ``\`` character can be used to escape characters mentioned above that should be ignored by the query language.

Example usage: 
    * ``tag:\*`` - will search the tags of resources of this type for text which exactly matches ``*``

    * ``tag\:`` - will search the tags of resources of this type for text which exactly matches ``tag:``
