Testbed REST API Reference
==========================

This page documents the endpoints and available HTTP methods for the Dioptra REST API.
In addition to using this page, it is highly recommended that Testbed users also use the Swagger documentation that the REST API service automatically generates at runtime, which presents all of this page's information in an interactive format.
To access the Swagger documentation, just navigate to the web URL for the Testbed REST API service (omit the ``/api`` part at the end of the web address).

   Several of the Testbed demos that you can run on a personal computer publish the REST API service at the address http://localhost:30080.
